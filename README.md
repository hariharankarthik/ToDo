# THE TO-DO LIST APP

* An iOS app that uses a Realm database to persist data locally which helps manage your todo categories and items efficiently.
* This app also uses Cocoapods like SwipeCellKit to delete items of the list and ChameleonFramework to enhance the UX of the app.
* Several features implemented including the ability to search for items using a partial or full search.
* Since the data storage is persisted locally, the data in the app is always retained unless deleted.
